# Player Experience
This is a platformer game where the player fights the aliens to save the earth. In level one the player has to reach the spaceship under pressure (we were not able to add the time pressure feature)

# Core Mechanic
The player runs and jumps and escapes aliens. 

# Core Game Loop
 The player has to go from the start to the spaceship while avoiding aliens

# Game Theme
All the people will unite and take down the aliens.

# Technical Setup
We used a tilemap, tile palette, animator. For controls, we used crossPlatformInput manager from standard assets. We used cinemachine to make the camera 
move and follow the character. For our animation and assets, we used a website called pixilart.com, and we used a software called Gimp. 


# MVP Features - Finally what got done!
